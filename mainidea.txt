1. Train Text Model 
Extract the features from the text with the bot by passing the user's query to the model
by making a prediction.



2. Train Speech Model
Audio (for speech stress/ emotion)
Extract features using librosa → MFCC, pitch, energy, jitter, RMS
Train a classification ML model
→ SVM / RandomForest / XGBoost



3. Train cam Model
Facial Emotion
Extract features
Use OpenCV to detect landmarks / facial ratios
Or use a pretrained model like FAcial Emotion via FER to get features
Train an ML classifier



4. Combine the outputs (Model Fusion)

I will not just use one model. Instead, combine predictions from:

Text Model

Speech Model

cam Model



5. Integrate into UI (Chatbot + Webcam + Audio)

Step 1: User chats with the personalized bot → text analysis

Step 2: Webcam capture - Before or during the chat (finite/always on) → facial evaluation

Step 3: Mic record - Before or during the chat (finite/always on) → voice analysis

Step 4: Fusion → risk prediction shown



6. Show the results/predictions on the user's dashboard and integrate "twilio" for notifications.







Models:
1️⃣ Logistic Regression (baseline)
2️⃣ Naive Bayes
3️⃣ SVM (try LinearSVC)
4️⃣ Decision Tree
5️⃣ KNN (optional: use only if dataset reduced)
6️⃣ XGBoost (final model)
